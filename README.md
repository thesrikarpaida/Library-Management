# Library-Management
This is a website for any Library Management System, done with the help of HTML, CSS and PHP.

It was run on xampp server.

To run this, copy all these files in the same folder in the database management server you use, here we used xampp server, so in the xampp server folder, and start with the **index.html** file.

_I was a teenage novice when I created this. I had no sense of proper organization of files into folders and all that stuff, hence everything in one place. Please don't mind._
